## Core Functionality 
These are projects on the core platform, which expand the gathering and cleaning operations to enable deeper analysis.

* Extract chat history user names and self-generate output name
* Build table of conversations for aggregate analysis

## Interface
These are projects on expanding the platform's ease of use, starting with cmd interface and eventually a gui?

* Given FB folder, allow users to navigate and build individual conversations
* Default data build and indexing - where does it go?
* How to encapsulate the neccesity of indexing 

## Analysis
Making it easier to extract insight from the data generated 

* Develop new tables (users over group and single chats, conversations as observable unit of analysis)
* Pre-defined seaborn visualizations

## Product Management
Going the distance

* Core unit testing framework
* Clearner dependency management
* Makefile?
